# ChatBot
ChatBot is a type of bot that is able to chat with real humans over the internet. This repository consists of a server for transferring messages, a normal client program, and the bot. The bot basically has a few coded responses to normal questions and phrases, but the rest uses machine learning to answer. Unanswered questions give email notifications and are available for you to type in the right answer, and that answer is saved for later, so if the same question were to arise, it would be immediately answered. This program uses a GUI window and uses mouse and keyboard manipulation, so don't be surprised if your keyboard types and mouse moves without you doing it. You can send messages over different computers as well.
