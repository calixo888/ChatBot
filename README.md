# ChatBot v1.0
Fixed a few bugs in the code, no longer using sockets to communicate from one user to the other. Just a simple chat with a bot all wrapped up in one program. No longer using automation for the bot, just printing out a response, cleaned up the code, and made it run faster. Remember, this chatbot gets its knowledge the chatbot.txt which must be in the same directory as the bot, and you can fill it with any information and the bot will use it to respond to any questions.

# ChatBot
ChatBot is a type of bot that is able to chat with real humans over the internet. This repository consists of a server for transferring messages, a normal client program, and the bot. The bot basically has a few coded responses to normal questions and phrases, but the rest uses machine learning to answer. Unanswered questions give email notifications and are available for you to type in the right answer, and that answer is saved for later, so if the same question were to arise, it would be immediately answered. This program uses a GUI window and uses mouse and keyboard manipulation, so don't be surprised if your keyboard types and mouse moves without you doing it. You can send messages over different computers as well.
